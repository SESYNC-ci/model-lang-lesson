## A Little Advice

- Don't *start* with generalized linear mixed models! Work your way up through
  1. `lm()`
  1. `glm()`
  1. `lmer()`
  1. `glmer()`

- Take time to understand the `summary()`---the hazards of secondary data compel
  you! The vignettes for [lme4](){:.rlib} provide excellent documentation.

When stuck, ask for help on [Cross Validated]. If you are having trouble with
[lme4](){:.rlib}, who knows, [Ben Bolker] himself might provide the answer.
