## Lesson Objectives

- Learn about R functions and extensions for statistical modeling
- Understand the "formula" part of model specification
- Introduce increasingly complex "linear models"
- Meet Stan, the MCMC sampler

===

## Lesson Non-objectives

(Pay no attention to these very important topics.)
{:.notes}

- Experimental/sampling design
- Model validation
- Hypothesis tests
- Model comparison

===

## Specific Achievements

- Write a `lm` formula with an interaction term
- Use a non-gaussian family in the `glm` function
- Add a "random effect" to a `lmer` formula
- Sample parameter values for a GLM with [rstan](){:.rlib}
